stands for central processing unit, and it's responsible for guiding your computer as it processes data, much like a brain guides a body. That's the core computational in a server. Server and other smart devices convert data into digital signals and perform mathematical operations on them. The CPU processes the signals and makes computing possible. This brain fetches instructions from memory, perform the required tasks, and sends output back to memory. It handles all computing tasks required for running the operating system and applications.

### Whats are the components of a CPU?
A CPU is a complex electronic circuit that comprises several key components that process data and run instructions. The main components of a CPU are given next.

- **Control Unit** 
	The control unit manages instructions processing and coordinates data flow within the CPU and between other computer components. It has an instruction decoder component that interprets the instructions fetched from memory and converts them into micro-operations that the CPU can run. The control unit directs other CPU components to perform required operations.

- **Registers**
	Registers are small, high-speed memory storage locations within the CPU. They hold data that the CPU is currently working on and facilitate quick access to data. CPU's have several types of registers, like these:
	- General-purpose registers that hold operational data.
	- Instructions registers that hold that current instructions being processed.
	- A program counter that holds the memory address of the next instructions to be fetched.
	Registers provide faster access times that other memory levels like 
	RAM or cache memory.

- **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)**
	Performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and logical operations (AND, OR and NOT) on data. It receives data from registers within the CPU, processes it based on the instructions from the control unit, and produces the result.
