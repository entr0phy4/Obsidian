A computer network architecture establishes the theoretical framework of a computer network, including design principles and communications protocols.

### Primary types of network architectures
- [[Peer-to-peer (P2P) architectures]]: In a P2P architectures, two or more computers are connected as "peers," meaning they have equal power and privileges on the network. A P2P network doesn't require a central server for coordination. Instead, each computer on the network acts as both a client (a computer that need to access a service) and a server (a computer that provides services to clients). Every peer on the network makes some of its resources available to other network devices, sharing storage, memory, bandwidth and processing power across the network.
