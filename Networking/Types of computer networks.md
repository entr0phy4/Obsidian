Typically, computer networks are defined by geographical area, A local area network (LAN) connects computers in a defined physical space, while a wide area network (WAN) can connect computers across continent. However, networks are also defined by the protocol they use to communicate, the physical arrangement of their components, how they manage networks traffic and the purpose they serve in their respective environments.

## Network types by geographical area

**Local Area Network (LAN)**
A LAN connects computers over a relatively short distance, such as those within an office building, school or hospital, LAN's are typically privately owned and managed.

**Wide Area Network (WAN)**
As the name implies, a WAN connects computers across large geographical areas, such as regions and continents. WAN's often have collective or distributed ownership models for network management purposes. Cloud network serve as one example, since they're hosted and delivered by public and private cloud infrastructure across the globe.

A software-defined wide area network (SD-WAN) is a virtualized WAN architecture that uses [[Software-Defined Networking (SDN)]] principles to centralize the management of disconnected WAN networks and optimize performance.

**Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)**
MAN's are larger than LAN's but smaller than WAN's. Cities and government entities typically own and manage MAN's.

**Personal Area Network (PAN)**
A PAN serves on person. If a user has multiple devices from the same manufacturer (an iPhone and a MacBook, for instance), it's likely they've set up a PAN that shares and syncs content, text messages, emails, photos and more across devices.

## Network types by transmission medium
Network nodes can send and receive messages using either wired or wireless links (connections).

**Wired networks**
Wired network devices are connected by physical wires and cables, including copper wires and Ethernet, twisted pair, coaxial or fiber optic cables. Network size and speed requirements typically dictate the choice of cable, the arrangement of network elements and the physical distance between devices.

**Wireless networks**
Wireless networks forgo cables for infrared, radio or electromagnetic wave transmission across wireless devices with built-in antennae and sensors.

### Network types by communication type
Computing networks can transmit data using a range of transmission dynamics, including:

**Multi-point networks** 
In a multi-point network, multiple devices share channel capacity and network links.

**Point-to-point networks**
Network devices establish a direct node-to-node link to transmit data.

**Broadcast networks**
On broadcast networks, several interested "parties" (devices) can receive one-way transmissions from a single sending devices. Television stations are a great examples of broadcast networks.

**Virtual Private Networks (VPN's)**
A VPN is a secure, point-to-point connection between two network endpoints. It establishes an encrypted channel that keeps a user's identity and access credentials, as well as any data transferred inaccessible to hackers.
