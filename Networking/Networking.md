Networking, or computer networking, is the process of connection two or more computing devices, such as desktop computers, mobile devices, routers or applications, to enable the transmission and exchange of information and resources.
>Networked devices rely on communications protocols, rules that describe how to transmit or exchange data across a network to share information over physical or wireless connections.

Before we delve into more complex networking topics, it's important to understand fundamental **networking components**, including:

- [[IP address]]: An IP address is the unique number assigned to every network devices in an Internet Protocol (IP) network; each IP address identifies the device's host network and its location on the network. When one device sends data to another, the data includes a "header" that includes the IP addresses of both the sending and receiving devices.
- [[Nodes]]: A node is a network connection point that can receive, send, create or store data, It's essentially any network device, computers, printers, modems, bridges or switches, that can recognize, process and transmit information to another network node. Each node requires some form of identification (such and IP or MAC address) to receive access to the network.
- [[Routers]]: A router is a physical or virtual device that send data "packets" between networks. Routers analyze the data within packets to determine the best transmission path and use sophisticated routing algorithms to forward data packets until they reach their destination node.
- [[Switches]]: A switch is a device that connects network devices and manages node-to-node communication across a network, making sure that data packets reach their intended destination. Unlike routers, which send information between networks, switches send information between nodes within a network.
	Consequently, "switching" refers to how data is transferred between devices on a network. Networks rely on three main types of switching.
- [[Ports]]: A port indicates a specific connection between network devices, with each port identifies by a number. If an IP address is analogous to a hotel address, the ports are the suites and room numbers. Computers use port numbers to determine which application, service or process should receive which messages.
- [[Gateways]]: Gateway are hardware devices that facilitate communication between two different networks. Routers, firewalls and other gateway devices use rate converters, protocol translator and other technologies to make inter-network communication possible between otherwise incompatible devices.
