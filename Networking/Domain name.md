A domain name is a string of text that maps to an alphanumeric [[IP address]], used to access a website from client software. The actual address of a website is a complex numerical IP address (e.g. 192.0.0.2), but thanks to [[Domain Name System (DNS)]], users are able to enter human-friendly domain names and be routed to the websites they are looking for. This process is known as a DNS lookup.
