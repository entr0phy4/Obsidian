Like broadcast media, a WLAN transmits information over radio waves. Information is sent in packets. The packets contain layers with labels and instructions that work along with unique [[Media Access Control (MAC)]] addresses assigned to endpoints to enable routing to intended locations.
WLAN is general term referring to any wireless technology.
