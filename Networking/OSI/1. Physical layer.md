the layer includes the physical equipment involved in the data transfer, such as the cables and [[Switches]]. this is also the layer where the data gets converted into a bit stream, which is a string of 1's and 0's. The physical layer of both devices must also agree on a signal convention so that the 1's can be distinguished from the 0's on both devices.
