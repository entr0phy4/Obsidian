This is the only layer that directly interacts with data form the user. Software applications like web browsers and email clients rely eon the application layer to initiate communication. But it should be made clear that client software applications are not part of the application layer; rather the application layer is responsible for the protocols and data manipulation that the software relies on the present meaningful data to the user.
Application layer protocols include [[Hipertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)]] as well as [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)]]
