The network layer is responsible for facilitating data transfer between two different networks. If the two devices communicating are on the same network, the network layer is unnecessary. the network layer breaks up segments from the transport layer into smaller units, called packets, on the sender's devices, and reassembling these packets on the receiving device. The network layer also finds the best physical path for the data to reach its destination; this is known as routing.

Network layer protocols include IP, the [[Internet Control message Protocol (ICMP)]], the [[Internet Group Message Protocol (IGMP)]] and the [[IPsec]] suite.
