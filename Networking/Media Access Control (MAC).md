Is that determines who is allowed to access the physical media at any one time. It acts as an interface between the logical link control sub-layer and the network physical layer. The MAC sub-layer is primarily concerned with recognizing where frames begin and end in the bit-stream received from the [[1. Physical layer]] (when receiving) delimiting the frames (when sending).
MAC protocols are used to determine how devices on a network can access the network and share its bandwidth. They help to coordinate the transmission of data packets between different devices to prevent collisions and ensure that data is transmitted reliably and efficiently.
The **[[MAC address]]** is a unique identifier assigned to every network interface controller (NIC) in a device. It is used to identify devices on a network and ensure that data packets are sent to the correct device. The MAC address is essential for network communication, as it enables devices to communicate with each other over a shared network medium.
