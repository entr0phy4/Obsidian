Search for files in a directory hierarchy.

```bash
find ./directory
```

Some filters we have with find are:
- `-type`: receives the type of the file we want find.
-  `-size`: receive the size of the file you want to find.

**Flags**
`-readable`: we can list files only human readable.
`-executable`: list executable files.
`-writable`: list files with write perm.
