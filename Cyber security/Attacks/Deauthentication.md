A deauthentication attack is a wireless attack in which an attacker will send multiple deauthentication frames to a station to overwhelm them which can result in a denial of service to either a selected station (client device) or to every station on the network. This would allow for the attacker to combine this with another attack called [[The evil twin]] or even use this to capture a [[4-way handshake]] which could be cracked using dictionary attack to obtain the access point's passphrase, which we are not going to cover here as we are purely focusing on the deauthentication attack.
