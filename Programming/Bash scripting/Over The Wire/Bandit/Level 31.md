**Password**: fb5S2xb7bRyFmAvQYQGEqsbhVyJqhnDy
**Tools**: [[git]]

**Prev**: [[Level 30]]
**Next**: [[Level 32]]

## Solution
There is a git repository at `ssh://bandit31-git@localhost/home/bandit31-git/repo` via the port `2220`. The password for the user `bandit31-git` is the same as for the user `bandit31`.

Clone the repository and find the password for the next level.

In this level we need  do a push of a file called `key.txt` and the content: `May I come in?`
and get the password.
