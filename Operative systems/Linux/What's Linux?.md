Linux is an open-source [[Operative System (OS)]] that runs on many devices, including computers, servers and mobile phones. It's free alternative proprietary operating system like Microsoft Windows and MacOS. The Linux operating system comprises several different pieces:
1. [[Bootloader]]: The software that manages the boot process of your computer. For most users, this will simply be a splash screen that pops up and eventually goes away to boot into the operating system.
2. [[Kernel]]: This is the one piece of the whole that is actually called **Linux**. The kernel is the core of the system and manages the CPU, memory and peripheral devices. The kernel is the lowest level of the OS.
3. [[Init system]]: This is a sub-system that bootstraps the user space and is charged with controlling daemons. One of the most widely used init systems is Systemd, which also happens to be one of the most controversial. It is the init system that manages the boot process, one the initial booting is handed over from the bootloader (i.e Grand Unified Bootloader (GRUB)).
4. [[Daemons]]: These are background services (printing, sound, scheduling, etc.) that either start up during boot or after you log into the desktop.
5. [[Graphical server]]: this is a sub-system that displays the graphics on your monitor. It is commonly referred to as the X server or just X.
6. [[Desktop environment (DE)]]: This is the piece that the users actually interact with. There are many desktop environment to choose. Each desktop environment includes built-in applications (such as file managers, configuration tools, web browsers, and games).
